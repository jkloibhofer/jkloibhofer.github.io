I am a PhD candidate at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation ([ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl/)) of the University of Amsterdam. My supervisors are [Yde Venema](https://staff.science.uva.nl/y.venema/) and [Bahareh Afshari](https://www.gu.se/en/about/find-staff/baharehafshari).

I am interested in mathematical logic, where I mainly work in proof theory and related areas. My PhD project concerns non-wellfounded proofs. These are proofs that allow infinite branches or cycles making them suitable for logics with fixpoints or induction.
